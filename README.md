# Genetics and Bioinformetics - resources
This isn't a project directory - this is just a collection of notes and references for Bioinformatics and genetic sequencing.


Data Structures and Algorithms:
- The YouTube channel Ben Langmead:
  - [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpb-mH-yjLc&list=PL2mpR0RYFQsBiCWVJSvVAO3OJ2t7DzoHA)
    - FastA and FastQ formats
    - Naive exact matching
    - Boyer-Moore, Preprocessing, and (k-mer and other) Index methods
    - The challenges of Assembly
      - Similarity suggests overlap
      - Duplication
      - Duplication
      - Greater coverage => Greater overlaps
